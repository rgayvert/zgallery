A TableModel maintains the rows and columns in reactive lists (ArrayAtoms), so rows and columns may be added and removed easily. 

The table model used here uses random data, and the table is configured to allow columns to be selected when a header cell is clicked.

You can add a row with random data by clicking on "Add Row", and you can delete a row if a row is selected and there is more than one row in the table. You can also select a column and delete it if there is more than one column in the table.
