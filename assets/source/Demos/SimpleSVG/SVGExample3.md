Here we have a collection of Bezier curves created using SVG paths. To illustrate the effect of the control points, each path is parsed to extract four points, which are then used to draw a pair of lines with dots on the ends.

This was adapted from https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Tutorial/Paths.
