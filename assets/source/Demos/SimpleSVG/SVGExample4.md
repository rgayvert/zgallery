This example shows how you can define and reuse an SVGGroup. A group is created like other components, and other SVG components appended to it. To reuse it, you create an SVGUse component with the group and an offset. Note that there is no need to specify an id or href, since these are generated automatically.

In addition, we show how the stroke-linejoin attribute can be specified to yield different effects on the paths.
