An icon displays a small image or SVG file. The source URI should be of the form "icon.xxx", which will be resolved by the AppResources instance. This can resolve to a file in the application assets folder, or to a reference to a font icon. In this example, "icon.shopping-court" resolves to "material-symbols-outlined-shopping_cart", which references the font icon set loaded by the GalleryApp with App.useGoogleFont().
