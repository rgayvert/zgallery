A menu may be placed anywhere relative to its reference view using a placement specification (see the [Placement demo](<<LINK_PREFIX>>/demos/placement) for some examples). 

In this example we have an HStack of buttons. Each button has a floating menu, and is assigned a random semantic color. The menus are placed using the standard place names: left, top, right, and bottom. When a button is clicked and a color choice made, the selected value will become the color of the button (because the button color and menu choice are the same reactive value).
