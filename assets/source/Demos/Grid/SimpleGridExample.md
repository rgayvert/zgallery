A Grid component is a layout which uses a CSS grid; that is, a view with a display attribute of "grid", along with other assorted grid options.

The subviews to be contained within the grid are simply appended to Grid view. In this example, we set up the grid to have 2 rows and 3 columns, and append a centered text label for each of the values in the data array.

For more examples of grids, see the [Tables demo](<<LINK_PREFIX>>/demos/tables).
