Transition Example 1 - State-based effects
<br>
Transitions in Zaffre can be implemented using state-based *effects*. An effect is an animation controlled by a reactive trigger.
Each view has reactive state values for mounted, hidden, selected, and contentChanged, along with an interaction value for enabled, disabled, hovered, pressed, focused, dragged, and draggedOver.
<br>
There is a standard collection of predefined transitions for effects like fad, grow, slide, collapse, and pop. You can also easily create additional custom effects.
