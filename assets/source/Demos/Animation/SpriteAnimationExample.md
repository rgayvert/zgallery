Sprite Animation
  
A sprite animation is a frame-based animation in which each item has an image which varies
from frame to frame. A sprite image is defined as a rectangular region inside a shared image. At
each step, each sprite moves and chooses a new image.
This example has a single "pacman" sprite with 3 sprite images, and moves to the right.
