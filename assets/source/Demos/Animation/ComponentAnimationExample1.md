Zaffre provides several different ways to add animation to a component. The first two examples here use an AnimationSpec, which translates directly into CSS animation attributes. You can slso use effect-based animations and frame-based animations.

Notes:

- The box is given an animation spec that is defined using key frames.
- The reactive value *model.running* controls when the animation runs.
- The switch controls the model.running value.
