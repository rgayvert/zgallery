A Sidebar is a responsive layout intended to contain two children, a sidebar and a content view. The sidebar has a fixed width, and the content grows to fill the available space. In addition, the content width must be at least some fraction (default is 50%) of the available width. The two views will be side-by-side when possible, otherwise the sidebar will appear above the content.
