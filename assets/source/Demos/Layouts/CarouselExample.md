A Carousel is an Ensemble which includes controls to move the visible view forward or backward. This example creates a sequence of images; the image paths are stored in a carousel atom, which yields a circular sequence. Note that the children are preloaded so that there isn't a lag when changing the view. An option is also added to allow the carousel to move automatically (every 3 seconds).
