VStacks and HStacks are the most commonly used layout components; that is, components whose purpose is to arrange and manage other components. The simplest types of layouts are illustrated here; more complex layouts such as Grids, Lists, and Trees have their own demo categories.

A VStack is a vertical flexbox which by default is non-wrapping, and centers its children horizontally and vertically. A gap between children can be specified, typically using a core.space.* token. In this example we start the items at the top, and include a Spacer to provide more space between the second and third items.
