Tiles is a classic puzzle consisting of an n x n grid of numbered squares, where one square is empty. The goal is to get the tiles in numerical order from 0 to n^2 - 1. When you click on a numbered tile that is in the same row or column as the empty tile, the tiles between that tile and the empty tile will be shifted.

There is an option to create the UI using either box with absolutely positioned tiles, or as a Grid. The Grid version is simpler, but does not have a way of smoothly moving the tiles.
