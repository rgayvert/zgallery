Adding SVG
<br>  
SVG components may be constructed and added to HTML components. Zaffre treats HTML and SVG components are near equals. The syntax and use of reactive values is very similar. The main difference is that an SVG containter (\<svg\>) may only contains SVG views.

Notes:
  - Here we have an SVG added to a VStack.
  - The SVG contains an SVGCircle and SVGText.
  - The SVG components may have reactive attributes. In this example, the circle radius and text font size vary with the length of the reactive input.
