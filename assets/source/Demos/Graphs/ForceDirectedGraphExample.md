A force-directed algorithm for graph layout determines how to position each vertex so that there is little or no overlap of edges, typically involving physical notions of springs, repulsive forces and gravity. A ForceDirectedGraph is a graph where each vertex has a mass and force, in addition to a 2D location, which aids in applying a force-directed algorithm. A ForceDirectedGraph is also an AnimationItem (because it implements step()), so it can be added to an Animation. This means that the display will update as the locations of the vertices changes.

The basic algorithm is iterative. It starts by assigning a random location to each vertex. Each iteration of the algorithm adjusts the locations: gravity pulls the vertices to the center, edges like springs to attract adjacent vertices, and non-adjacent vertices have a repulsive effect. 

In this example we create a random graph with 100 vertices and 50 edges. The initial display will be scrambled, since the vertex locations are randomized. Hitting the start button will begin the animation. Each step of the animation iterates 16 times through the adjustment algorithm, and this repeats 50 times. After a few seconds, the layout will stabilize and the animation will stop. You can then drag any vertex to a new location, and the animation will run again, with fewer adjustments.
